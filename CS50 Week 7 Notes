IP address stands for Internet Protocol and it is the address of the computer on the web. Protocol just means that it follows a certain set of rules.
TCP/IP

IP addresses the packets and TCP ensures they are delivered.

The form of an IP address is: #.#.#.#. Each # is between 0-255. The address is 32 bit made from 8 bit numbers. Organizations have different prefixes to their IP addresses. ie. 140.247.#.# = Harvard. There are prefixes for private networks that are not on the Internet at large.

An example of the pieces in play are laptop -> AP access point (ie. home router) -> switch -> Router -> Cloud (rest of the Internet)
																					   	   -> DHCP Server
																					   	   -> DNS Server

At home the everything to the right of the AP access point is replaced by a modem connecting you to your service providers equipment.

DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) Assigns IP addresses to computers.

DNS (Domain Name System) Translates website urls to to IP addresses and vice versa.
	Hostnames are similar to DNS as they allow you to address servers by names rather than numbers.

nslookup facebook.com (in terminal)
Server:   140.247.233.163      (2)
Address:  140.247.233.163#53   (3)

Non-authoritative answer:
Name: facebook.com
Address: 173.252.120.6         (7)
The first part, lines 2-3, is the address of Harvard’s DNS servers, and the last line, line 7, is its response to the question of what Facebook’s IP address really is. And if we copied that number, and went to info@173.252.120.6, we’ll indeed end up at facebook.com.

TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) Used by routers along with IP to guarantee delivery of packets to the right address. It will tell you if packets are missing by numbering the packets.

TCP has numbers associated with certain services because they transmit different types of information.
ports
21 FTP
25 SMTP
53 DNS
80 HTTP
443 HTTPS

FTP (File Transfer Protocol)
SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) is for outbound mail.
DNS makes queries of what a website address is.
HTTP (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol)
HTTPS (S is for secure I think) Has a TCP number greater than 255 because it has to do with TCP not IP. A port number is 16bit.

Most common is 80 and 443 for web.

TRACEROUTE

traceroute is a terminal program that allows you to see the servers between you and an address.

HTTP REQUESTS

Your machine (Client) -> request -> Web Server Machine (Responds with information)

Clients use GET requests to ask for information.
The server responds with a status code and the requested data if the code is good.

Status codes.
200 OK
301 Moved Permanently
302 Found
401 Unauthorized
403 Forbidden
404 Not Found
500 Internal Server Error

What is given back is HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) along with Javascript and CSS. This is run by your web browser to display a web page.


PART 2 : HTTP Review

It is a protocol computers use to transfer data over the web.

When you post a GET request it is placed in a digital packet with your IP address. The / after GET and in a web address just refers to the root directory of the server.

HTML

Declare an html document with <!DOCTYPE html> at the top.
Declare the beginning and end of the page with <html> </html>
Then you want a head section with <head> </head> containing a title with <title> </title> and a body for text with <body> </body>.

html is like the root of a tree structure with all its elements descending from it. This is Called a DOM (Document Object Model)

The web browser opens files by address and if the file is on your computer it would look something like this: Notice that the URL in the address bar reads file:///home/jharvard/Desktop/hello.html, indicating that we are looking at a file on our local hard drive, and no one else should be able to see it.

SERVERS AND PERMISSIONS

The appliance can be used as a web server using to sets of software. MySQL for a database and Apache for a web server.

vhosts/localhost/public/ 1 is the root folder that our sever software looks into, localhost means your computer and public is the publicly accessible folder.

If you move a file into this folder, you can access it through chrome by putting your ip address with a /filename at the end.
To access and image through an html file it requires certain tags (<img src=img.jpg/>) for the right request; however, the file needs to have the right permissions on the server to be accessed.
You view the permissions with ls -l in the terminal.
chmod a+r file
This will change the permissions to all read. Meaning the file is readable by everyone.

LINKS

Link tags look like this: <a href=info@google.com/>search for cats</a>.
a is for anchor, href for hyper text reference, then we have the url, then the text that will be shown to a human.

Then we have lists, paragraphs and tables. REVIEW FOR ME.

FORMS

To see what is happening when a webpage is requested we need to use dev tools network tab. When reloading a page hold shift to reload the whole thing so that you can bypass cached info and see the whole process.

When a browser first gets HTML. It goes through the tags and downloads the specified resources from the locations they are at.
You can create a form action to make your own mini search engine on top of google like this.

<!DOCTYPE html>

<html>
    <head>
        <title>CS50 Search</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>CS50 Search</h1> 
        <form action=https://info@google.com/search method=get> 
            <input name=q type=text/> 
            <br/>
            <input type=submit value=CS50 Search/>
        </form>
    </body>
</html>

A body style tag can be used to align text: <body style=text-align: center> (this is CSS)

CSS

Stands for cascading style sheets. Used to add aesthetics to a webpage. Visual changes.
CSS uses key value pairs. ie. text-align: center.
You link a page to a style sheet with this: <link href=search-3.css rel=stylesheet/>

EXAMPLE OF CSS & HTML:

<!DOCTYPE html>

<html>
    <head>
        <style>

            #header
            {
                text-align: center;
            }

            #content
            {
                text-align: center;
            }

            #content input
            {
                margin: 5px;
            }

            #footer
            {
                font-size: smaller;
                font-weight: bold;
                margin: 20px;
                text-align: center;
            }

        </style>
        <title>CS50 Search</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <div id=header>
            <img alt=CS50 Search src=logo.gif/>
        </div>
        <div id=content>
            <form action=https://info@google.com/search method=get>
                <input name=q type=text/>
                <br/>
                <input type=submit value=CS50 Search/>
            </form>
        </div>
        <div id=footer>
            Copyright &#169; CS50
        </div>
    </body>
</html>

PHP

Is a scripting language used on the web.

$ declares variables and they do not need to have type specified.

Most of the logic is the same as C. if statements, for loops, etc.

foreach ($numbers as $number)
{
    // do this with $number
}

this gives allows you to run code for each element of an array.

Arrays are pre initialized with [] ie. $numbers[1,2,3,4,4]

php has associative arrays which are like dictionaries or hash tables

$quote = [symbol => FB, price => 79.53];

SECTION

Ports are used by TCP to let you know what kind of data is being transmitted.
