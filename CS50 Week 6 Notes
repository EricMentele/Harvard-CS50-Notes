CS50 Week 6 Notes

LINKED LIST

Pros:
Dynamic insertion with malloc and update of a few pointers.
Easily resized because of dynamic memory allocation.

Cons:
Linear search only. No random access.
Pointers for nodes take extra memory.
O(n) for search, deletion, and insertion.

Hash Tables

Hashing is basically putting things in piles. Like taking in an odd number and assigning it to an index in an array where all odd numbers get assigned from that point on to keep them together. You can take other values and hash them to a number. An example would be hashing name tags alphabetically.

Linear probing



HASH TABLE STRUCTURE

Building blocks: Arrays, linked lists, structs.

Array: Could be declared with dynamically like this, char* table[CAPACITY];
The array stores pointers to a linked list in each index or NULL.

Linked Lists: Attached to different indexes of the array.
Nodes for linked list

typedef struct node
{
    char* word;
    struct node* next;
}
node;

Declare structure of hashtable:
node* table[CAPACITY];

TREES AND TRIES

Tree

An array of nodes pointing to a node in another array of nodes.

Trie

A tree optimized for retrieval.

The nodes have a bool added indicating if it is an end of a word.

STACKS AND QUEUES

A linked list or an array can be used for these.

TREES

Root -> children-siblings (leaves). It looks like an upside-down tree with the root at the top. Every tree under the root is a subtree.

A binary tree is one where a parent has a maximum of two siblings.

Made with nodes that look like

typedef struct node
{
    int data;
    struct node* left;
    struct node* right;
}
node;

A tree allows for the construction of a two dimensional linked list.

Thinking with recursion, if the integers are in a sorted order, you get a binary search tree.

Example algorithm

bool search(int n, node* tree)
{
    if(tree == NULL)
    {
        return false;
    }
    else if (n < tree->n)
    {
        return search(n, tree->left);
    }
    else if (n > tree->n)
    {
        return search(n, tree->right);
    }
    else
    {
        return true;
    }
}

A binary search tree all nodes to the right of a root are greater than the root and values to the left are less than it. A binary search trees upper bound is O(n) unless it is balanced. When balanced, meaning that both sides are even in nodes, the upper bound of  O(logn). Trees are great for handling insertions and deletions.

MORE ON TRIES

A trie is a hash table like structure made of arrays with nodes at their indices's. The first index of every array is the root node. The root node says if the array has data or not. Tries run in constant time.
